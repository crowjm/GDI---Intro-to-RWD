					<h2>What We'll Cover Today</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What are Responsive Web Design &amp; Mobile First?</li>
						<li>Why should you care?</li>
						<li>How to make your site mobile-first and responsive.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Today we're going to be building our foundation of RWD so tomorrow we can build our own responsive site. Covering history, theory, and practicing in code.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
					<p>Back in the day (aka the late 2000s), mobile was rarely considered in development. When it was, it was a lesser version of a desktop site.</p>
					<p>The Internet wasn't fun on your phone. üôÅ</p>
					<aside class="notes">Reference point: first iPhone didn't come out until 2007.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Present Day</h2>
					<div class="image__group" style="display:flex; justify-content:space-around;">
						<img src="images/buzzfeed.jpg" alt="buzzfeed books homescreen" style="height:50%;">
						<img src="images/google.jpg" alt="google search bar" style="height:50%;">
						<img src="images/tacodeli.jpg" alt="taco menu" style="height:50%;">
					</div>
					<p>The Internet is awesome on your phone. üòä</p>
					<aside class="notes">Ask if people stop looking at a site on their phone if it's not mobile-friendly.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
					<p>Mobile First and Responsive Design.</p>
					<img src="gifs/lesliewhat.gif" class="fragment">
					<aside>We're going to talk about mobile first, first.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is Mobile First?</h2>
					<p>Mobile First started being talked about around 2010.</p>
					<p>Rather than starting your design with the desktop, the idea of mobile first is to start designing and building for small screens, and grow from there.</p>
					<aside>Maybe draw this proces on a white board? <br/> Mobile first fits really well something called progressive enhancement. (ask if anyone knows what that is). PE is the idea of starting with a comprehensive foundation for your site, and adding flourishes from there. This way your content can always be accessed, even if just HTML is rendered.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Mobile Means Different Things</h2>
					<div class="image__group" style="display:flex; justify-content:space-around;">
						<img src="images/globalphone2016.png" class="fragment" style="height:50%; width:50%;">
						<img src="images/iphone2016.png" class="fragment" style="height:50%; width:50%;">
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">Explain that in the first chart, top smartphones worldwide, iPhone isn't even in there. Phones I've never head of before. iPhone is v common in the US, but there are so many types of them. People would ask for an "iphone site," but there are so many more types of phones. You don't want to just design/develop for one resolution.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>There Are a Lot of Things You Can't Control</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What device the user has.</li>
						<li>What if the user's JavaScript doesn't load?</li>
						<li>What if the user's CSS doesn't load?</li>
						<li>The user's connection speed.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Designing for the LCD</h2>
					<p>More than just your content and design, Mobile First is about desiging and developing for the lowest common denominator.</p>
					<p>With Mobile First, you also want to consider designing for devices that don't load your CSS and/or JS.</p>
					<p>You want your site to be as performant as possible.</p>
					<p>Mobile First means designing in a way that will make your content as accessible as possible for your users. All of 'em.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Mobile First</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Mobile First helps you simplify and prioritize your content.</li>
						<li>Mobile First makes your site more perfomant and accessible.</li>
						<li>Mobile First helps ensure a great user experience.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">So now let's transition to RWD.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is Responsive Web Design (RWD)?</h2>
					<p>RWD is part philosophy and part front end strategy. RWD is the crafting of websites that will be functional and beautiful regardless of which screen they're viewed on.</p>
					<p>It originated in 2010, around the same time as Mobile First.</p>
					<p>Combine RWD with Mobile First for a wonderfully built site.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>The long and short of it is that we're designing for more devices, more input types, more resolutions than ever before. The web has moved beyond the desktop and it's not moving back.</blockquote>
					<p><small>‚ÄîEthan Marcotte</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">This quote is from Ethan Marcotte, who coined the term RWD back in 2010. <br/> So this is really similar to Mobile First, in that the world has moved beyond the desktop. But RWD isn't just about ensuring a good mobile experience. It's about making sure your user can access your site and content no matter what device, screen size, resolution, etc. they're using. So phones, tablets, desktops, laptops, tvs-even watches and glasses.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why Responsive Web Design?</h2>
					<blockquote>...No design, fixed or fluid, scales seamlessly beyond the context for which it was originally intended.</blockquote>
					<p><small>‚ÄîEthan Marcotte</small></p>
					<p>RWD allows us to create seamless experiences for our users that will work regardless of the device they're using.</p>
					<aside class="notes">Let's take a look at some examples!</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Content Adapts</h2>
					<img src="gifs/adaptive.gif">
					<aside class="notes">Ask how people are feeling-if they need a break before we get into the how of RWD?</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Brain Break!</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Three Tenants of RWD</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fluid Grid</li>
						<li>Flexible Media</li>
						<li>Media Queries</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">So we've covered the what and why of RWD, let's move onto the how.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Fluid Grid</h1>
					<img src="gifs/cat-underwater.gif">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>In order to be responsive, we need to express our grid (containing and container elements) in flexible, relative, proportional terms (percentages).</li>
						<li>TL;DR: % not px</li>
						<li>This percentage will represent the width of the containing element, which means it will reflow according to viewport widths.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Target / Context = Result</p>
					<p>Wherein...</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Target is the div you want to find the % of</li>
						<li>Context is parent div</li>
						<li>Result is width as %</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">RWD involves some math. We're going to use this formula a lot today and tomorrow.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<img src="images/grid_001.png">
					<aside class="notes">So we've mocked up this site, but everything is in pixel values. Let's work together to make it responsive. The first thing we'll do is turn the main column section into a percent.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p>Target = 640, context is 960</p>
					<p>What will the percentage be?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Answer: 66.666666666667%</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p>Let's turn the rest into %</p>
					<img src="images/grid_001.png">
					<aside class="notes">Work on sidebar first and then margins.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p>Let's turn the rest into %</p>
					<img src="images/grid_003.png">
					<aside class="notes">Awesome! We have all our percentages and are ready to start developing.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<img src="images/code_001.png">
					<aside class="notes">Before, this is what our code would have looked like.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<img src="images/code_002.png">
					<p><small>*Round up to 4% to make it fit</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">And now, this is what our code looks like! Aso really only need to go 4 decimal places, unless you want to be v in depth, which is okay! Whatever you prefer.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p><small><strong>How do we turn the Context into a %?</strong></small></p>
					<img src="images/grid_003.png">
					<aside class="notes">One thing we missed, which is our container.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p>We could...</p>
					<pre><code>.container { width: 100%; } </code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Let's see what that does...</p>
					<p class="fragment">There are some issues, a little stretched out...</p>
					<aside class="notes">After "let's see what that does,"" move to codepen to show.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Grid</h2>
					<p>Let's try....</p>
					<p><pre><code>.container { width: 100%; max-width: 960px; } </code></pre></p>
					<p class="fragment">Much better!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Develop It!</h2>
					<p><a href="https://www.goo.gl/kDk6to">go here: goo.gl/kDk6to</a></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make a CodePen account if you don't have one already.</li>
						<li>Fork the pen from the link above.</li>
						<li>Change the px values to fluid percentages.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Flexible Media</h1>
					<img src="gifs/flexible.gif">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Media</h2>
					<p>Use percentages for images' (or gifs' or videos', etc.) dimensions so that they can grow and shrink as user adjusts browser.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Media</h2>
					<p>Secret sauce:</p>
					<p><pre><code>img { max-width: 100%; }</code></pre></p>
					<p>This will ensure our image is never larger than its containing element.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Media</h2>
					<p>Let's add images to our practice site!</p>
					<p><pre><code><img src="http://placekitten.com/700/200" alt="kitten"></code></pre></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Media</h2>
					<p>Now, let's add...</p>
					<p><pre><code>img { max-width: 100%; }</code></pre></p>
					<p class="fragment">What if we want to make it smaller?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Flexible Media</h2>
					<p>Add a class to it!</p>
					<p><pre><code>.cat { width: 50%; }</code></pre></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Develop it!</h2>
					<p>Add 3 cat images to your site, make them sit side by side using %</p>
					<p><img src="images/cats.png"></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Media Queries</h1>
					<img src="gifs/change.gif" style="width:50%;">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Media Queries</h2>
					<p>Media queries are a test for the browser. If conditions (like height, width, resolution) are met, certain styles will be shown. If not, browser will skip over.</p>
					<p>Use media queries when you need them in the design, not at prescribed device viewport widths.</p>
					<p>The point where a media query happens is a breakpoint.</p>
					<aside class="notes">There are a lot of types of media queries.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Media Queries</h2>
					<pre><code>@media all</code></pre>
					<p>Applies to all media types: screen, print, tv...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Media Queries</h2>
					<pre><code>@media print</code></pre>
					<p>For printers</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Media Queries</h2>
					<pre><code>@media screen and (resolution: #dpi)</code></pre>
					<p>For high resolution devices, like retina displays. You can use this to display higher res images to higher res devices.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>So many!</h2>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>@media all and (orientation: landscape)</code></pre>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>@media all and (orientation: portrait)</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">There's even...</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>@media 3d-glasses</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>If you Google...</h2>
					<p>You may see...</p>
					<pre><code>@media only screen ...</code></pre>
					<p>"Only" is used so older browsers ignore the code.</p>
					<p>This will only work in devices:</p>
					<pre><code>@media screen and (min-device-width)</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Media Queries</h2>
					<pre><code>@media screen</code></pre>
					<p>The one you want to use! Browsers and mobile devices are in this category.</p>
					<p>We'll combine this with a min-width to change things about our design at certain sizes.</p>
					<pre><code>@media screen and (min-width: width)</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Develop it!</h2>
					<p>Add a media query to your site that makes the background teal at 600px.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><pre><code>@media screen and (min-width: 600px) { body {background: teal;} }</code></pre></p>
				</section>

					<h2>Desktop first?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Design desktop site first?</p>

					<h2>Remember!</h2>
					<blockquote>The absence of support for @media queries is in fact the first @media query.</blockquote>
					<p><small>‚ÄîBryan Reiger</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">Even having access to media queries is a test for the browser. Want to make sure you're not hiding content/important design details in a media query, because not all users will be able to access them</aside>

				<h2>Fluid Typography</h2>
					<img src="gifs/bunny.gif">
					<aside class="notes">One more thing we can learn to make our sites even more fluid, and that's typography</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Typography</h2>
					<p>As Mobile First and RWD gained traction, fluid typography came on the scene.</p>
					<p>Fluid typography means your type adjusts as the screen size changes.</p>
					<p>An awesome first step is using em instead of px. Ems are a unit of measurement that's relative to the base font-size.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fluid Typography</h2>
					<p>16px is the default font-size. It's our context. You can change it, but the calculations get trickier.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Target / 16px = em</p>
					<p class="fragment">Let's figure out our ems on our practice site!</p>
					<aside class="notes">Work through one with them, let them change the rest</aside>
